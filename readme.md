# Server-information minecraft plugin
## Brief introduction
This project was created when I planned to create my own minecraft server that was massively custom coded. This plugin was used to let players easily access information regarding the server, which would respond with a message with the required information.

This included the following commands, which explain what they do themselves.
/discordlink, /serverip, /staff, /rules, /store

*Note, this readme.md has been created years+ after the initial commit, so some information might be missing/incorrect*
